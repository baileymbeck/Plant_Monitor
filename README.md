## General info
This project primarly utilizes raspberry pi, python, Django, and sensors
from Adafruit for the purpose of demystifying phrases like: "low light", 
"bright indirect light", and "moist but not soggy soil". It can be difficult
to care for plants and the vague instructions can mean different things to
different people. I'm hoping that with this project I can provide solid
data to allow more people to enjoy their houseplant by removing the 
omnipresent concern of "Was that too much water? ... I'll just give another 
splash to be sure..."
Over the course of a few months each, I'll record data daily on a variety of plants with a notes section to provide illustrations of progress through that time.

## Inspiration
Being new to programming, I've been having a blast learning new tools and I thought this would be a great start because it combines all my favorite things. I hope to set this up so that it can be easily reproduced by others so that more data can be collected on a wide range of plants.
