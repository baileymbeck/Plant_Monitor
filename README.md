## General info
This project primarly utilizes raspberry pi, python, Django, and sensors
from Adafruit for the purpose of demystifying phrases like: "low light", 
"bright indirect light", and "moist but not soggy soil". It can be difficult
to care for plants and the vague instructions can mean different things to
different people. I'm hoping that with this project I can provide solid
data to allow more people to enjoy their houseplant by removing the 
omnipresent concern of "Was that too much water? ... I'll just give another 
splash to be sure..."
Over the course of a few months each, I'll record data daily on a variety of plants with a notes section to provide illustrations of progress through that time.
